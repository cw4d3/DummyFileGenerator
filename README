:: Dummy File Generator ::
========================

This is an application under construction. Eventually, it will allow the user to create 
dummy files of different kinds (image, audio, video, document, executable, etc.) for use 
in testing. The main area I see that may be the most useful is for testing file upload 
validations for size restrictions and file type restrictions.
